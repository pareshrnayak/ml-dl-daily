# ML & DL Daily Practice 🚀

This repository contains my **daily practice and learning** of  
**Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** concepts using **Python**.

The focus of this repository is to **understand concepts clearly**, implement
algorithms step by step, and build a **consistent learning habit** while creating
a useful public resource for beginners.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build strong fundamentals in Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Practice daily using small, focused problems  
- Learn algorithms conceptually (not just library usage)  
- Maintain consistency in learning and GitHub contributions  
- Create a beginner-friendly reference for ML/DL concepts  

---

## 🧠 What This Repository Contains

- Simple and well-commented Python implementations  
- “From scratch” implementations to understand core logic  
- Library-based implementations for comparison  
- Clear explanations written in easy-to-understand language  
- Experiments and observations from daily practice  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- PyTorch  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

---

Each topic folder includes:
- Python implementation files  
- A README explaining the concept in simple terms

---

## 📘 How to Use This Repository

- Start with **ML → Regression → Linear Regression** if you are a beginner  
- Read the README inside each folder before going through the code  
- Run the code, experiment with parameters, and observe results  
- Use this repository as a learning guide or reference  

---

## 🌱 Who This Repository Is For

- Beginners learning Machine Learning or Deep Learning  
- Students pursuing AI / Data Science related fields  
- Anyone who wants to understand how ML/DL works internally  
- Learners who prefer understanding over memorization  

---

## ⭐ Note

This repository is maintained as a **daily learning log** and will grow
gradually with consistent practice.

Learning, clarity, and consistency are the priorities.
